# Pokedex
Pokedex Project for the final program.

## Description
This program reads a list of Pokemon from a file and stores them in a binary tree. It then displays the Pokemon in order. Each Pokemon has an index and a name. The program ensures that no duplicate Pokemon are added to the binary tree.
